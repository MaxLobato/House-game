I created a haunted house game in which you are stuck in a haunted mansion and are looking
for a way out. The computer (the ghost) chooses and option (one of the 5 routes) when the player chooses one. 
The same rules apply as for the 'Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" they ar just made to be doors.
When the player wins, the player escapes, and when they loose, the ghost catches them. When a tie occurs, the
player enters a new room in the house and has the chance to choose again so as to escape. If that player has another 
tie, they enter yet another room, and the "rooms" value increases. If that player looses or wins, that value returns to 0.
